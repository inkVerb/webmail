# Webmail

This repository contains a simple webmail implementation for golang:

* You can connect to a remote IMAP server and perform basic operations
  * Retrieve the list of remote folders.
  * Open a folder and see the appropriate messages.
     * Unread messages will be displayed in bold.
     * Messages which have been replied to will be shown with an icon.
     * Messages with attachments will display a "paperclip" next to them.
     * You can page back/forward by 50 messages.
  * For any message in the folder list you can retrieve it
     * Which will also mark the message as being read.
     * The message will be displayed as (filtered) HTML, Plain text, and RAW as applicable.
     * Attachments will be displayed and may be downloaded.

This application has been tested against three remote IMAP hosts:

* GMail
* GMX
* My mailserver, running dovecot.

All perform well, though in all honesty my own server performs the worst
because I have ~1000 mailboxes.  So just getting the folder list takes
some time I'd rather avoid.

# Screenshots

## Installation

To install this run:

nkverb/
     ~ $ go get -u github.com/inkverb/webmail
nkverb/
     ~ $ go install github.com/inkverb/webmail

## Usage

Build the application and start it:

     ~$ webmail

Now point your favourite browser at http://localhost:8080/ and fill in the appropriate details.  For example if you wished to test against Google-mail you'd enter the following values:


| Value    | Setting                 |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| Host     | imaps://imap.gmail.com/ |
| Username | example@gmail.com       |
| Password | s3cr1t                  |


**NOTE**: If you want to us IMAP (143) use `imap://` as a prefix, if you want IMAPS (993) use `imaps://`.  To avoid issues I'm __NOT__ validating the SSL certificate.  This is intentional.  Sorry.



## Limitations

The main limitation is that this is a naive webmail client, which means that
every time you carry out an option the flow goes:

* Your browser sends a request to this server.
* The server opens a __new__ connection to the remote IMAP server:
  * The appropriate command(s) are executed.
  * The IMAP server connection is closed.
* The server sends the response to your client.

This means that things are slower than they would be if there were a dedicated
proxy maintaining a persistent connection to the IMAP server.


## Missing Features

You cannot:

* Delete a message.
* Reply to a message.
* Forward a message.
* Compose a fresh message.

Some of those would be simple to add, others more complex.


## Hacking

The generated HTML views are stored inside the compiled binary to ease
deployment.  If you wish to tweak the look & feel by editing them then
you're more then welcome.

The raw HTML-templates are located beneath `data/`, and you can edit them
then rebuild the compiled versions via the `implant` tool.

If you don't already have `implant` installed fetch it like so:

nkverb/
     go get -u  github.com/inkverb/implant/
nkverb/
     go install github.com/inkverb/implant/

Now regenerate the compiled version(s) of the templates and rebuild the
binary to make your changes:

    go generate
    go build


## Thanks

This project wouldn't have been possible without the use of some excellent libraries:

* The go-imap library, which we use extensively:
  * https://github.com/emersion/go-imap/
* The enmime library we use for parsing emails, and attachments:
   * https://github.com/jhillyerd/enmime
* The following HTML-sanitizer makes the display of HTML-messages less dangerous:
   * https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday
